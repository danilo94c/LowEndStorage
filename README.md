# [LowEndStorage](https://www.lowendstorage.win)

This site compiles a list of Low End Storage solutions into a sortable table to analyze all options.

The jQuery plug-in, [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), is used to structure and sort the data.

All prices are in USD. Foreign currencies are converted to USD and may not be accurate at time of viewing.

## General Requirements

General requirements for services that are presented in this table:
1. Provider offers a plan with storage of >= 250GB
2. Price of the storage plan is <= $10/mo

## Data

Data that is used to populate the table is stored within the [data.json](data.json) file.

Due to a limitation of the DataTables plug-in, the table rows need to be generated and placed within the HTML file prior to rendering the webpage. Because of this, a Python utility dubbed, 'build_rows.py', has been created to automatically read in the data.json file and generate the HTML code for the table rows. Then the rows that are spit out can be dumped within the index.html page between the two markers.

```bash
./build_rows.py > table-rows.html
```
